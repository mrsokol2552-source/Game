# Unity Project Skeleton

This folder contains a minimal Unity structure to start the 2D RTS.

- Open in Unity (2021 LTS or newer recommended)
- Create a sample scene, add a GameObject with `HudController` and wire it later
- Scripts are layered: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation
- ScriptableObject stubs live under `Assets/ScriptableObjects/Configs`

Assembly definition files can be added/linked in Unity as needed.
